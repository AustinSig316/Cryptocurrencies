# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
This project goal was to use unsupervised machine learning to create a portfolio of cryptocurrencies to enter into the market. The data was slightly modified for visualization and database purposes. It was then clustered so a classification system could be created to help group and understand the cryptocurrency market to make better decisions on what to enter and invest in.
